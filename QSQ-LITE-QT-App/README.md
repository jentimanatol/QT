# User Management & SQLite Integration in Qt

## Introduction to SQLite and Qt SQL Module

SQLite is a powerful, self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration SQL database engine. It is widely used in applications that require lightweight database management with minimal setup, particularly in embedded systems, mobile apps, and local data storage for desktop applications. SQLite is a C-language library that provides a relational database management system (RDBMS), allowing applications to store and query data efficiently.

Unlike other popular databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server, SQLite operates in a more simplistic, self-contained manner. It does not require a separate server process and works directly with files. This makes it especially useful for applications with limited database interaction or those where a full-fledged database server is not required.

### **Comparison of SQLite with Other Databases**

| Feature               | **SQLite**                          | **MySQL/PostgreSQL**                | **SQL Server**                      |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Server Requirement**| No server needed                    | Requires a server                  | Requires a server                  |
| **Setup Complexity**   | Minimal setup (file-based)          | Moderate (requires server setup)    | High setup complexity              |
| **Use Cases**          | Embedded systems, mobile apps, local data storage | Web applications, enterprise-level apps | Enterprise-level apps              |
| **Performance**        | Great for lightweight tasks, limited concurrent access | Excellent for high concurrency and large datasets | Great for large-scale enterprise apps |
| **Platform**           | Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) | Cross-platform                       | Primarily Windows                  |

While SQLite excels in simplicity and portability, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server offer superior performance for complex applications with high concurrency and distributed architectures. They are ideal for server-based applications that need to manage large datasets and handle complex transactions.

## SQLite in Qt

Qt, a powerful cross-platform C++ framework, provides a built-in SQL module that allows developers to easily integrate SQLite and other database systems into their applications. The `QSqlDatabase` class, along with `QSqlQuery` and `QSqlError`, is used for connecting to, querying, and handling errors related to databases.

The Qt SQL module supports several database drivers, including the `QSQLITE` driver, which allows for seamless integration of SQLite databases within Qt applications.

### **How to Use SQLite in Qt**

Here is an example of how to set up a connection to an SQLite database in a Qt application.

```cpp
#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <QSqlDatabase>
#include <QSqlError>
#include <QSqlQuery>
#include <QDebug>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    QCoreApplication a(argc, argv);

    // Database connection parameters
    QString dbPath = "C:/BHCC/qt/serverClient/DatabaseConnectionApp/testdb2/usermanagement.db";

    // Set up SQLite database connection
    QSqlDatabase db = QSqlDatabase::addDatabase("QSQLITE");
    db.setDatabaseName(dbPath);

    // Try to open the database
    if (!db.open()) {
        qDebug() << "Error: Unable to connect to database." << db.lastError().text();
        return -1;
    }

    // Print success message
    qDebug() << "Connected to database successfully";

    // Close the database connection
    db.close();

    return a.exec();
}
```

### **Explanation of the Code**:

1. **QCoreApplication**: Initializes a core Qt application that runs without a GUI. This is typically used for console applications.
2. **QSqlDatabase::addDatabase("QSQLITE")**: This creates an SQLite database connection using the `QSQLITE` driver. The driver is automatically included with Qt, making SQLite very easy to integrate.
3. **db.setDatabaseName(dbPath)**: Sets the path to the SQLite database file. In this example, the file `usermanagement.db` is located at `C:/BHCC/qt/serverClient/DatabaseConnectionApp/testdb2/`.
4. **db.open()**: Opens the connection to the database. If the database cannot be opened, an error message is logged.
5. **db.close()**: Closes the database connection after the operations are complete.

This simple example demonstrates how to open a database and check if the connection is successful. Once the connection is established, you can execute SQL queries using the `QSqlQuery` class.

## User Management System Overview

The **User Management System** project allows users to register and manage their account details through a basic SQLite-based database. It consists of two main tables: `User` and `Account`.






# User Management & Account System

 This project demonstrates how to manage users and their accounts with SQLite and SQL. The application allows for easy user registration, login, and account management, using a simple yet effective database structure.

This README will guide you through the components of the project, including:

1. **Database Design**: Understanding the database schema.
2. **DB Browser (SQLite)**: Introduction to the tool, how to use it, and how it differs from SQL Workbench.
3. **Project Overview**: Explanation of how the project works, its functionality, and setup.

---

## 1. **Database Design**

The database for this project is built with SQLite, and it contains two main tables: `User` and `Account`. Here’s a detailed description of the schema.

### **User Table**

The `User` table stores the details of users in the system. It contains the following fields:

- **user_id** (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT): The unique identifier for each user. It is automatically incremented whenever a new user is added.
- **username** (TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE): The username chosen by the user. It must be unique to ensure that no two users share the same username.
- **password** (TEXT NOT NULL): The password for the user. It is stored in plain text (for simplicity, but in a real-world application, passwords should be hashed).
- **email** (TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE): The user's email address, which must also be unique.

### **Account Table**

The `Account` table is used to store information about user accounts. Each user can have multiple accounts (e.g., savings, checking). The table contains the following fields:

- **account_id** (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT): A unique identifier for each account.
- **user_id** (INTEGER): The ID of the user who owns the account. This is a foreign key referencing the `user_id` in the `User` table.
- **account_type** (TEXT NOT NULL): The type of account (e.g., "savings", "checking").
- **balance** (REAL DEFAULT 0.0): The current balance of the account, defaulting to 0.0.

### **SQL Commands**

```sql
-- Create table for user details if it doesn't exist 
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS User (
    user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

-- Create table for account details if it doesn't exist
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Account (
    account_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER,
    account_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    balance REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES User(user_id)
);

-- Insert users
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO User (username, password, email) VALUES ('alice', 'alice123', 'alice@example.com');
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO User (username, password, email) VALUES ('bob', 'bob123', 'bob@example.com');

-- Insert accounts
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Account (user_id, account_type, balance) VALUES ((SELECT user_id FROM User WHERE username = 'alice'), 'savings', 1000.0);
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Account (user_id, account_type, balance) VALUES ((SELECT user_id FROM User WHERE username = 'bob'), 'checking', 500.0);

-- Check user login
SELECT user_id, username 
FROM User 
WHERE username = 'alice' AND password = 'alice123';

-- Fetch user details
SELECT * 
FROM User 
WHERE username = 'alice';

-- Fetch account details for a user
SELECT Account.account_id, Account.account_type, Account.balance
FROM Account
JOIN User ON Account.user_id = User.user_id
WHERE User.username = 'alice';

-- Fetch user and account details
SELECT User.username, User.email, Account.account_type, Account.balance
FROM User
JOIN Account ON User.user_id = Account.user_id
WHERE User.username = 'alice';
```

The commands above perform the following actions:

- **Create Tables**: The `User` and `Account` tables are created if they don’t already exist.
- **Insert Users**: Sample users (`alice` and `bob`) are inserted into the `User` table.
- **Insert Accounts**: Corresponding accounts for users are inserted into the `Account` table.
- **Check Login**: A query to check if a user with the username `alice` and the password `alice123` exists.
- **Fetch User Details**: A query to fetch all details of the user with the username `alice`.
- **Fetch Account Details**: A query to retrieve account details for the user `alice`.
- **Fetch User and Account Details**: A query to retrieve both user and account details for `alice`.

---









### **Project Features**

- **User Registration**: Users can register with a unique username, password, and email address.
- **Account Management**: Users can create different types of accounts (e.g., savings, checking) linked to their profile.
- **Login System**: A simple login mechanism that verifies user credentials.
- **Database Integration**: The system uses an SQLite database to manage users and their accounts locally.

### **How the Project Works**

1. **User Registration**: When a user registers, their data is inserted into the `User` table.
2. **Account Creation**: Each user can have multiple types of accounts (e.g., checking, savings), which are stored in the `Account` table.
3. **Login Verification**: When the user logs in, the application checks the `User` table to validate the entered credentials.
4. **Account Details**: Once logged in, the system retrieves the user's account details from the `Account` table.

---

## How to Use the User Management System in Qt

1. **Setup the Project**:
   - Open Qt Creator and create a new Qt Console Application project.
   - Include the necessary modules (`QSqlDatabase`, `QSqlQuery`, `QSqlError`) in your `.pro` file:
   
   ```plaintext
   QT += core sql
   ```

2. **Create the SQLite Database**:
   - Open DB Browser for SQLite or SQLite command line and create the `User` and `Account` tables using the SQL commands provided.
   - Insert some sample data to test the functionality.

3. **Connect to the Database**:
   - Add the code to establish a connection to the SQLite database as shown above in the main function.

4. **Execute SQL Queries**:
   - Use `QSqlQuery` to run queries such as user registration, account creation, and login verification.
   
   Example of a query to insert a new user:
   ```cpp
   QSqlQuery query;
   query.prepare("INSERT INTO User (username, password, email) VALUES (:username, :password, :email)");
   query.bindValue(":username", "charlie");
   query.bindValue(":password", "charlie123");
   query.bindValue(":email", "charlie@example.com");
   if (!query.exec()) {
       qDebug() << "Error inserting user: " << query.lastError().text();
   }
   ```

5. **Test the Application**:
   - Build and run the application to test user registration, login, and account management functionality.
