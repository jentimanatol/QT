## How to Use the Script

### Step 1: Download the Script

First, you need to download the batch script. You can get the file `delete_user_files.bat` from the repository or wherever it's provided.

- **File Name:** `delete_user_files.bat`
- **Purpose:** Deletes all `.user` files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

### Step 2: Place the Script in the Right Folder

For the script to work effectively, you need to place the `delete_user_files.bat` batch file in the directory where your `.user` files are stored. This ensures that the script can locate and delete all files with the `.user` extension in that location.

- **Example Directory Path:** `C:\BHCC\qt\SQL-QT\Test-SQL-db-drivers-conection\TestSQLConnection`

### Step 3: Running the Script

Once youâ€™ve placed the script in the correct directory, itâ€™s time to run it:

1. **Double-Click the `.bat` File:**
   - Simply double-click the batch file (`delete_user_files.bat`) to execute it. The script will automatically open a Command Prompt window.
   - The script will do the following:
     - Change the directory to the location where the batch file is placed.
     - Delete all `.user` files in the current directory and any subdirectories under it.

2. **Observe the Results:**
   - After running the script, you will see a quick message indicating that the script has completed, and the `.user` files should be gone. This will help free up space or reset user settings.

## Script Breakdown

Now, letâ€™s take a closer look at whatâ€™s happening in the script. Understanding the commands will allow you to customize the script or troubleshoot if necessary.

Hereâ€™s the full script for reference:

```batch
@echo off
cd /d "%~dp0"
del /s *.user
```

### Command-by-Command Breakdown:

#### 1. `@echo off`

- **Purpose:** This command disables the echoing of each command in the Command Prompt window.
- **Why It's Useful:** It keeps the output clean by not showing each command as it is executed. You only see the important messages (like success or error messages), making it easier to follow the scriptâ€™s progress.

#### 2. `cd /d "%~dp0"`

- **Purpose:** This command changes the current working directory to the location where the batch file is placed.
- **Explanation:**
  - **`cd`**: This is the "change directory" command.
  - **`/d`**: Allows the change of both the directory **and** the drive if necessary.
  - **`%~dp0`**: This is a special parameter that expands to the **drive** and **path** of the batch file. It allows the script to "always" start from the folder it is located in, even if you run the script from a different location.
  
- **Why Itâ€™s Useful:** This ensures that the script works correctly regardless of where it's executed from, as it always starts in the right directory.

#### 3. `del /s *.user`

- **Purpose:** This command deletes all files with a `.user` extension in the current directory and all subdirectories.
- **Explanation:**
  - **`del`**: This command deletes files.
  - **`/s`**: Tells the script to delete `.user` files not just in the current directory, but also in all subdirectories under it.
  - **`*.user`**: The `*` wildcard matches any file ending with `.user`.
  
- **Why Itâ€™s Useful:** This allows the script to clean up all user-specific configuration files, even if they are spread across multiple folders.

## Additional Notes

### Backup Important Files

Before running any script that deletes files, itâ€™s always a good idea to **backup important data**. While this script specifically targets `.user` files, itâ€™s better to be safe than sorry. If you're not sure which files are crucial, make sure to keep backups.

### Customizing the Script

This batch file is designed to be simple and effective, but it can easily be customized to fit your needs. Here are a few ideas for modification:

- **Target Different File Extensions**: If you need to clean up other types of files, you can modify the `*.user` part. For example, change it to `*.log` to delete all `.log` files.
  
- **Target Specific Folders**: You can also change the directory by specifying a different path. Instead of using `"%~dp0"`, you can replace it with a fixed path like `"C:\Path\To\Your\Folder"`.

### Troubleshooting

- **Error Deleting Files:** If the script isn't deleting any files, ensure that the `.user` files exist and that you have the necessary permissions to delete them. Sometimes, files might be locked by another application, in which case youâ€™ll need to close that application first.
  
- **File Path Issues:** If the path to your batch file is too long or contains spaces, you might need to enclose it in double quotes to prevent errors.
