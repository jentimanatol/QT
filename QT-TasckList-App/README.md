## Code Structure

### Main Components
- **MainWindow**:
  - Manages the layout, task addition, task removal, and status updates.
- **Task**:
  - Represents an individual task with features like marking as complete, renaming, and removal.

---

### Code Details

#### `MainWindow`
The `MainWindow` class serves as the primary interface and manages the overall application behavior.

**Key Functions**:
- `addTask()`: Creates a new `Task` object and adds it to the task list.
- `removeTask(Task* task)`: Removes a task and updates the status.
- `taskStatusChanged(Task* task)`: Handles changes in task completion status.
- `updateStatus()`: Updates the display to show the count of completed and pending tasks.

---

#### `Task`
The `Task` class defines the behavior of individual tasks in the list.

**Key Functions**:
- `setName(const QString& name)`: Sets the task name.
- `isCompleted() const`: Returns whether the task is marked as complete.
- `rename()`: Opens a dialog box to edit the task name.
- `checked(bool checked)`: Updates the UI to strike through completed tasks.

**Signals**:
- `removed(Task* task)`: Emitted when the task is removed.
- `statusChanged(Task* task)`: Emitted when the taskâ€™s completion status changes.

---

## User Interface Design

### `MainWindow.ui`
- A **toolbar** at the top with:
  - **Status Label**: Displays the count of pending and completed tasks.
  - **Add Task Button**: Opens a dialog to add a new task.
- A **task layout** below for dynamically displaying task widgets.

### `Task.ui`
- **CheckBox**: Marks the task as complete or incomplete.
- **Edit Button**: Opens a dialog to rename the task.
- **Remove Button**: Deletes the task from the list.

---

## Environment Details

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit) or Linux.
- **Development Tools**: Qt Creator 6.8.1, MinGW 13.1 or MSVC 2022.
- **Dependencies**: None outside the Qt framework.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Task Persistence**:
   - Save tasks to a local file or database for future sessions.
2. **Task Sorting**:
   - Allow sorting tasks by name, creation date, or status.
3. **Dark Mode**:
   - Add a toggle for dark mode in the user interface.
4. **Priority Levels**:
   - Introduce prioritization with visual indicators for tasks.
