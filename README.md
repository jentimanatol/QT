## Environment Setup

### **1. Installing the Qt Framework**
1. Download the latest version of [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download) (recommended version: **6.8.1**).
2. During installation, ensure you select the following components:
   - **Qt 6.8.1 MinGW 64-bit** or **Qt 6.8.1 MSVC 2022 64-bit** (choose based on your compiler).
   - **Qt SQL Module** (required for database integration).
   - **Qt Network Module** (required for networking projects).

### **2. Installing MySQL Server and Connector**
MySQL is required for the `SQL-QT` project or any database-related tasks.

1. Download [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and install it.
2. Download the MySQL Connector driver files:
   - `qsqlmysql.dll_Qt_SQL_driver_6.8.1_MinGW_13.1_64-bit.zip` (for MinGW builds).
   - `qsqlmysql.dll_Qt_SQL_driver_6.8.1_MSVC2022_64-bit.zip` (for MSVC builds).
3. Extract the `qsqlmysql.dll` file and place it in the `sqldrivers` folder of your Qt installation:
   ```plaintext
   C:/Qt/6.8.1/mingw_64/plugins/sqldrivers/ (for MinGW)
   C:/Qt/6.8.1/msvc_64/plugins/sqldrivers/ (for MSVC)
   ```

### **3. Verifying the SQL Driver Installation**
1. Open Qt Creator and create a new C++ console project.
2. Use the following code snippet to check for available SQL drivers:
   ```cpp
   #include <QDebug>
   #include <QSqlDatabase>

   int main() {
       qDebug() << "Available SQL drivers:" << QSqlDatabase::drivers();
       return 0;
   }
   ```
3. Ensure that `QMYSQL` is listed in the output.
