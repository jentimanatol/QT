## üåç **Setting Up Your Environment**

### **1. Install Qt Framework**  
1. Visit the [Qt Download Page](https://www.qt.io/download) and download the installer.
2. During installation, select:
   - **Qt Version**: 6.8.1 or higher.
   - **Compiler Kits**: Choose either:
     - MinGW 64-bit (13.1).
     - MSVC 2022 64-bit.
   - **Qt Modules**: Include SQL and Network modules.

3. After installation, verify the setup by launching **Qt Creator** and creating a sample project.

---

### **2. Install MySQL Server and Connector**  
1. Download and install [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).  
2. Download the MySQL Connector driver compatible with your Qt installation:
   - For MinGW builds: Use `qsqlmysql.dll_Qt_SQL_driver_6.8.1_MinGW_13.1_64-bit.zip`.  
   - For MSVC builds: Use `qsqlmysql.dll_Qt_SQL_driver_6.8.1_MSVC2022_64-bit.zip`.  

3. Extract the `qsqlmysql.dll` file and place it in the `sqldrivers` directory of your Qt installation:  
   ```plaintext
   C:/Qt/6.8.1/mingw_64/plugins/sqldrivers/ (for MinGW)  
   C:/Qt/6.8.1/msvc_64/plugins/sqldrivers/ (for MSVC)  
   ```

4. Verify the SQL driver installation by running the following code:
   ```cpp
   #include <QDebug>
   #include <QSqlDatabase>
   int main() {
       qDebug() << "Available SQL drivers:" << QSqlDatabase::drivers();
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   Ensure `QMYSQL` is listed in the output.
