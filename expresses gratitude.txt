**Dear Professor Miller,**

I hope this note finds you well. As the course comes to an end, I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for everything you have shared with us throughout this journey.  

Thank you for your unwavering dedication to teaching and for sharing your immense knowledge with us. Your ability to break down complex concepts into understandable lessons and your enthusiasm for C++ and object-oriented programming have truly inspired me. It’s not just the skills I’ve gained but the perspective you've offered on problem-solving and perseverance that will stay with me as I move forward.  

I am also deeply grateful for your understanding and patience in allowing me to submit late work. It means a lot to have had the chance to learn and improve at my own pace without feeling defeated by missed deadlines. Your flexibility gave me the opportunity to focus on the quality of my work rather than rushing to meet the clock.  

At the same time, I want to sincerely apologize for not fully meeting all the requirements and not completing every assignment as expected. Life, as it often does, threw challenges my way, but that’s no excuse for not adhering to the expectations of your course. I regret not making the most of the opportunities to showcase my full potential in every aspect of the program.  

Nonetheless, the projects and assignments you provided were both challenging and rewarding. Each one felt like a puzzle waiting to be solved, and they helped me grow not only as a programmer but also as a thinker. Working through them was an adventure that taught me persistence, creativity, and attention to detail. The joy of watching a project come to life, knowing it stemmed from the skills and lessons you imparted, is something I will always carry with me.  

Thank you, Professor, not just for being a great instructor but for being someone who genuinely cares about their students’ growth. Your encouragement, support, and expertise have made a lasting impact, and I am honored to have been your student.  

Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors and continued success in shaping the next generation of learners.  

With immense gratitude,  
 Anatolie
